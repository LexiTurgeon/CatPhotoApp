# CatPhotoApp
Learning HTML - First project
This project was done with "freecodecamp.org". It is the first tutorial in learning HTML.

HTML tags give a webpage its structure. You can use HTML tags to add photos, buttons, and other elements to your webpage. With this project, I learned the most common HTML tags by building my own cat photo app.
